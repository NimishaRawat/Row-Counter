#Row Counter

I made a basic row counter website that one can use to count the number of people in a row. One can increment the number of people with increment button and save the value with save button. Once a value is saved the count sets to zero.
My website is responsive and easy to use.

Quick start:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
